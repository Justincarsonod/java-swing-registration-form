Java Swing Registration Form
This project demonstrates how to create a simple registration form using Java Swing for the front-end and JDBC for database connectivity. The form allows users to enter their details, which are then stored in a MySQL database. The application also retrieves and displays the stored data.

Features
User-friendly Interface: A simple Swing form with fields for Name, Mobile, Gender, Date of Birth (DOB), and Address.
Database Connectivity: Uses JDBC to connect to a MySQL database and store user data.
Data Display: Retrieves and displays stored user data in a JTable.
Form Validation: Basic validation to ensure data integrity.
Reset Functionality: Allows users to reset the form fields.
